;;; Code to time readings.
;;; Introduce a slot internal-time-to-read in object sectional-unit.
;;; If this slot is not set, then guess the time to read based on the
;;; weight.
;;; To set this slot with the right value, use a before and after
;;; method on read-aloud for class sectional-unit that records the
;;; universal time in this slot.
;;; The before method records when it started reading, the after
;;; method computes the difference from the present and stores this
;;; difference
;;; Bugs: Will only work if the default reading style for sectional
;;; units is active.
;;; Will not work if you interrupt the reading and continue, it will
;;; report the total time taken to read the unit.
