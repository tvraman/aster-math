;;; Implements a scaling operation to the current state.
;;; Allows for cleanly speeding up an entire rendering etc.
;;; Suggested by Jim Davis.

;;; This function uses a set of global scale factors initially set to
;;; unity.  They can be changed by the user to result in the entire
;;; reading being scaled. Will work with interruptions.
