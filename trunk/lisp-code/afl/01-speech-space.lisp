;;; Each fold contains functions associated with the fold marker
;;; { Introduction:

;;; This file contains definitions of points in the speech space.
;;; Points in the speech space are currently implemented as
;;; structures. A point in the speech space determines the parameter
;;; values along the various dimensions defining the space. Dimensions
;;; include head-size, breathiness, voice, volume etc.  The information
;;; pertinent to each dimension is captured in a structure called
;;; dimension.  Relevant information includes name of the dimension,
;;; value, default step size.
;;; the structure dimension captures those bits of information that
;;; are liable to change, eg: value, step-size. Synthesizer code will
;;; not change for a dimension during the program, so this is kept
;;; separately in a hash table. 
;;;
;;; The point in speech space will contain fields each of which will
;;; be assigned an object of type dimension encapsulating the current
;;; settings along that dimension.
;;; The structure for points in speech space is automatically
;;; generated from the list of dimensions specified by the user. 
;;; Global values are stored in a special structure that implements
;;; reference variables.  

;;; The dimensions in the speech space are first captured in a list
;;; called *list-of-speech-dimensions* and this is used by all the functions.
;;; The structure definition for point-in-speech-space is
;;; generated from this list by a macro.

;;; comments on initializing speech space:
;;; initializing speech space will include the following steps:
;;; Do a table lookup and get the values for the default voice
;;; specified by the user. Store associated values in the
;;; *global-values* so that global-set can manipulate it. Construct
;;; a point in speech space which is the origin and set current-state
;;; to this point.
;;;
;;; How this will be implemented:
;;; initialize-speech-space takes an optional argument a voice-name.
;;; It then looks up the default values for this voice. These are then
;;; entered into the various tables. Thus when this function finishes
;;; its work, we have the default settings as well as a start point.
