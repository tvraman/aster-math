backup made before modifying generate-synthesizer-command to
concatenate all commands before sending them out.

Tried it with generate-synthesizer-command returning a string and
set-state finally sending the concatendated  string to the dectalk but
this does not speed up.

Not making a backup of that version since change minimal.

Now introducing multiple-value-bind in local-set! and making move
operators return multiple values this is a major change.
implemented smart local-set etc. but this broke local-set with
interruptions. 


works after declaring modified-dimensions a defvar as this binds it to
the stack of calls.
