;;; Code to generate class definitions for operators.
;;; Should look in math classification table and generate class
;;; definitions for operators automatically.
;;; Set up a mapping between operator names and the names to be used
;;; for the classes.
;;; This is because the operators currently have the same names as
;;; used by TeX and hence not nemonic.
;;; eg: int should have its class called integral etc.
;;; Generate this mapping from the pronunciation table.
