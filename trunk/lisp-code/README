#Steps in installing aster:
1) cd to lexer subdirectory and execute make clean; make 
2) Set variables in lisp-init.lisp 
3) Change setting of lisp-program in the shell script 
afl-lisp (shell-scripts/afl-lisp) to 
point to your local installation of lisp. 
(Note: This should be a lisp image with clos loaded)
4) Install the emacs to lisp interface, ilisp
5) Make the necessary site-specific changes 
to ilisp-load.el (under emacs-interface)
6) Go through the file system-definitions/aster-configure.lisp. 
If there is some variable you wish to change, then uncomment it
(remove the initial ';;;' and set it to what you want)
Remake any .o files: 
a) cd afl/sound-audio; rm *.o; make 
(you may need to tell the makefile where to find libaudio.a)
7) Start up emacs, and load the file ilisp-loads.el 
8) Type M-x aster 

This should load everything and compile all the code. 
If your dectalk is connected and powered up, 
you'll hear messages as each module loads

(I suggest you get yourself a large cup of coffee before doing this) 

Create a directory called .read-aloud in your home directory and
create two files in it:

a) the file preamble.tex containing the line 
\begin{document}
and a file 
b) postamble.tex containing 
\end{document} 

These files are used by the emacs interface to create a tex file
containing the region of text to be rendered. 

Running the system:
You're pretty much on your own (until Bill Barry writes the
documentation:-)


Basically, you can mark of a region of text in any emacs buffer and
execute M-x read-aloud-region 
to have it audio formatted.
