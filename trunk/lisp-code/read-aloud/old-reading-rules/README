;;; This directory contains the old version of the reading-rules
;;; module. This version is being frozen on
;;; Tue Dec  8 13:46:52 EST 1992
;;; This version used an object called reading rule which contained a
rule name a class name and a rule definition which was a set of lisp
actions.
;;; The new version instead uses an around method on the class
document, see the top level directory.
;;; I decided to stop using the strategy used in this module because
it  became to messy to select a reading style. Note the messy use of
eval in activate-reading-style.
;;; Also, pulling outpieces of code out of  a hash table and sticking
them inside defmethod forms on the fly looks ugly.
;;;  The file math-reading-rules contains many helper functions and
methods along with a few reading rules.
;;; In the new version all these helper functions are being retained.
The only thing that needed to be changed from the define-reading-rule
used in this old module  to move to the new defmethod reading-rule is
the first defining line of the rule.
