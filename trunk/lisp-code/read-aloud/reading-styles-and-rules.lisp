 ;;; Tue Dec 8 12:17:21 EST 1992 This module replaces the
 ;;; reading-rules module defined in define-reading-rules.lisp.  The
 ;;; old version is kept in a subdirectory.  <(refer to
 ;;; define-reading-rules.lisp )> This version uses a CLOS oriented
 ;;; solution.  Reading rule is now a method which is called by the
 ;;; around method for read-aloud for the document class.  If no
 ;;; reading rule is active for a given object of type document, then
 ;;; a reading rule from the currently effective style is used.  If no
 ;;; style is currently effective, or no rule is defined in the
 ;;; current style for this object, then the default read-aloud method
 ;;; is used.
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
 ;;; Implementation  details:
 ;;; Reading-rule method will specialize on the class of its first
 ;;; argument and use an eql specializer on the second argument which
 ;;; is the rule name.
 ;;;  User level functions:
 ;;; (defmethod reading-rule ... )
 ;;; Alternately use macro def-reading-rule object-name rule-name ...
 ;;; (activate-rule object rule-name )
 ;;; (activate-style style-name)
 ;;; deactivate-rule  rule-name

 ;;; When an object that is of type document or a subclass of the
 ;;; document class is read, first the around method is called. The
 ;;; around method checks if any reading rule is currently active for
 ;;; this object. If a rule is active and is defined, then that rule is
 ;;; called. If no rule has been activated for this object, or the
 ;;; activated rule is undefined, then the current reading style is
 ;;; checked. If a reading rule has been defined for this object in
 ;;; the current reading style, then that rule is called.
 ;;; The default is to simply called the read-aloud primary method for
 ;;; this object, which can be thought of as the default reading rule.
 ;;; Since the around method  is always called first under the standard
 ;;; method combination, reading rules should  not just directly call
 ;;; read-aloud with the same argument  that was passed to the rule.
 ;;; This will of course generate an infinite loop.  If all that is
 ;;; desired  is to have the default read-aloud method  to be called,
 ;;; then no reading-rule need or should be defined.
