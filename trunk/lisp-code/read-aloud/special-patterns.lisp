(in-package :user)


;;; Sun Dec 27 07:56:14 EST 1992
;;; Implements code to allow the user to specify special patterns.
;;; This done by generating after methods for initialize-instance
;;; that check the created instance and if the instance matches a
;;; special pattern set the special-pattern slot.
;;; read-aloud can check this slot to see if a special pattern has
;;; been identified, and if in addition the special patterns reading
;;; style is active and a reading rule  called <special-pattern-value>
;;; has been defined for this object type, then that rule is called.
;;; Work out a clean way for specifying a number of special patterns
;;; to check for:
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;


;;;
;;; <(backed up. )>
;;; Checking for special patterns at initialization time is buggy.
;;; Instead introduce a generic method special-pattern which gets
;;; called before the object is read, in the around method for
;;; read-aloud. If special-pattern returns a special pattern, then
;;; read-aloud will invoke the reading rule of that name. 
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;


;;; Only math objects have special patterns for now:
;;; special-pattern is being memoized by adding a slot pattern to
;;; math-object. If later on other document objects  also need special
;;; patterns, then move this slot to the appropriate super class, and
;;; define the around method for that super class.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; Do nothing in the case of ordinary objects, just return nil. 
;;; around method not defined  in this case
;;; Moved to math-classes.lisp to avoid warning.



;;; Memoizing special-pattern
;;; Sun Feb  7 18:22:23 EST 1993
;;; Introducing ability to turn off special patterns selectively.
;;; Use a hash table to hold class names for which special patterns
;;; are active.
;;; This means that when a special pattern is written it will have to
;;; be explicitly activated.
;;; The hash table will hold the class name of the class for which the
;;; special pattern is being activated.
