;;; Implements float-if and delay-until
;;; Structure delay-object has two slots:
;;; object-name is an object name from the document class hierarchy,
;;; in general, any symbol. 
;;; delayed-form is the delayed form 
;;; Function delay-until takes an object name and a function object.
;;; It creates  the corresponding delay-object and installs it.
;;; Function force-if is called with a symbol.
;;; It forces all delay-objects that have this symbol as their
;;; object-name
;;;
