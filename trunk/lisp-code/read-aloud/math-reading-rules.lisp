;;; browsing.  <( Refer to old version for explanation)>
;;; Made more efficient:
;;; Begin a block for the array, and move to the left.
;;; when looping through arrays move to the right, and have a dummy
;;; block for reading the array element so that the right state gets
;;; recorded for relative browsing.
;;; read first element of each row and then loop, this will avoid
;;; having to check for the last element when stepping to the right.
;;; Make cleaner by using named reading states.
