Martin Luther King Day 2010.

The work describing AsTeR was presented to the faculty at Cornell
for my PhD on
Monday, Jan 17, 1994 (Martin Luther King Day)

** Contents 
this directory contains a cleaned version of AsTeR
Clean == 

  1) throw away unnecessary code. 
  2) Work under clisp and lucid. 

** Terms 

This code is is as-is --- i.e. it comes with no support.


** Brief Usage Instructions


***Pre-Requisites:

  1. CLisp --- I am using 
     clisp Version: 1:2.44.1-4.1ubuntu2

  2.  emacs --- I am using Emacs 23, though older Emacsuns will
      probably work, given that the code was written a long time
      ago.

  3. DEC-Talk Express for speech synthesis.

*** Starting Up

  1. Add <aster-math>/lisp-code/vanila-interface to your emacs load-path.

  2. M-x load-library run-lisp-setup

  3. M-x aster to start up CLisp and load the code. First time
     around might take a couple of mins as the code compiles.

  4. Build the lexical analyser in <aster-math>/lisp-code/lexer
     by:
     :cd lisp-code/lexer; make

  5. Open the sample text.tex file in Emacs.

  6. Mark a region of the document --- e.g., everything between
     the begn{document} and end{document} lines  --- note: region
     *should not* contain the begin/end lines

  7. Invoke emacs command read-aloud-region via key C-b C-d

  8. AsTeR should start reading the document. Use the AsTeR
     browser commands available on C-b to navigate and listen.

  9. For seeing available keystrokes in the browser, press C-b C-h.

  10. If you want to use this code with other TTS  engines,  you
      will need to write the necessary code.
