* Overview 

  - Audio System For Technical Readings  (AsTeR) front-end  is implemented in Emacs and integrated with Emacspeak.
  - We use Emacspeak TTS server ~dtk-soft~   to interface with the
    software DECTalk.
  - AsTeR accepts TeX/LaTeX markup and produces audio-formatted speech
    via the DECTalk.
  - AsTeR back-endis implemented in Common Lisp (SBCL).
  - We use package /slime/ to connect Emacs and Common Lisp.
  - Emacs commands call   the Lisp
    interpreter to control Aster.

* Pre-requisites 

  - Install  /slime/ and /auctex/using _M-x package-install_.
  - Install /SBCL/  and /cl-asdf/using  your linux system's package manager.
  - Install /flex/ and its dependencies for building AsTeR's lexical analyzer.
  - Install  [[https://github.com/dectalk/dectalk][Software DECTalk]] from Github.
  - Install Emacspeak 57.0 or later from Github.
  - Set _environment variable_ ~EMACSPEAK_DIR~ to point at the root of
    your Emacspeak install if not running AsTeR under emacspeak; Emacspeak does
    this for yu automatically. This setting is needed by the Common
    Lisp layer to  launch the TTS Server.

* Quick Install  
  1. _cd <emacspeak>_ to change to your _emacspeak_directory.
  2. Get source via git checkout [[https://github.com/tvraman/aster-math]]
  3. _cd aster-math/lisp  && make_

* Usage 

  - The user-interface to AsTeR is implemented in Emacs library _aster.el_;
   _M-x load-library_ /aster.el/ and run  _M-x aster RET_.
  - From here on, all Aster commands are found under Emacs prefix-key
    _C-; SPC_ and _C-' a_.
  - M-x describe-function aster gives a list of keybindings.
  - You can select  content to send to AsTeR for processing in a
   number of ways:
    - By sending an entire  LaTeX file.
    - By sending math content from any Emacs buffer.
    - While editing LaTeX markup, including from within org-mode buffers.
    - While browsing Wikipedia pages containing Math using Emacs'
      EWW browser . (Make sure to first disable _shr-discard-aria-hidden_ first).
    - From Emacs  Calculator (calc).
    - From the Emacs interface to Sage --- a symbolic algebra system.
  - Once Aster starts reading, you can use Aster's
   navigation commands to move around.
